	/*
	 * ArrayBlockingQueue is a bounded, thread-safe implementation of the BlockingQueue interface backed by an array.
	 * It is part of java.util.concurrent and is commonly used in producer-consumer problems.
	 * The queue has a fixed capacity, so once full, attempts to add more elements will block or fail based on the method used.
	 * Elements are ordered in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner.
	 *
	 * Common ArrayBlockingQueue Methods:
	 *  - add(item):         Inserts the specified element if space is available (throws exception if full)
	 *  - offer(item):       Inserts the specified element if possible (returns false if full)
	 *  - put(item):         Inserts the specified element, waiting if necessary for space to become available
	 *  - offer(item, timeout, unit): Inserts the specified element, waiting up to the specified time for space
	 *  - remove():          Retrieves and removes the head of the queue (throws exception if empty)
	 *  - poll():            Retrieves and removes the head of the queue (returns null if empty)
	 *  - poll(timeout, unit): Retrieves and removes the head, waiting up to the specified time if necessary
	 *  - take():            Retrieves and removes the head, waiting if necessary until an element becomes available
	 *  - peek():            Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue (returns null if empty)
	 *  - isEmpty():         Checks if the queue is empty
	 *  - size():            Returns the number of elements in the queue
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 *  - The capacity of the queue is set at creation and cannot be changed.
	 *  - Null elements are not permitted.
	 *  - Operations are thread-safe and support blocking behavior for both insertion and removal.
	 *  - Useful for coordinating work between multiple producer and consumer threads.
	 *  - Fairness policy can be optionally set to true for first-come-first-served access order.
